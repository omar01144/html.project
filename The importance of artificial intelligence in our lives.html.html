<p style="font-size:22px">The healthcare field is developing with increasing speed, accompanied by a significant increase in the amount of data and challenges in terms of costs and patient outcomes; So AI applications have been used to reduce these challenges,
</p>
 [1] The following are the most important examples of the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in this field: Prediction of intensive care unit conversions: Unplanned transfer of patients to the intensive care unit can lead to poor results, and in some cases it may even lead to the death of patients; So artificial intelligence was used to reduce the proportion of these cases, by finding patients with serious cases, where artificial intelligence systems use patients ’medical records, laboratory results, and vital signs to manage patients’ condition before it deteriorates, and having to transfer them to the intensive care unit, and it can guide Artificial intelligence systems doctors to the point of initiation of treatment.<p>
[2] Medical examination: unnecessary routine laboratory tests increase unnecessary financial costs; Therefore, artificial intelligence applications have been used to narrow the circle of laboratory analyzes that a patient may need.<p>
